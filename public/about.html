<p>My name is Joel Rodriguez.
  I was born in Cuba (1985) where I studied as a software engineer from 2003 to 2008 at "Universidad of Matanzas".
  In 2009 I moved to Chile and worked for Vidrios Bizama in the develpment of their transactional systems and website.
  In 2010 I relocated to Barcelona Spain where I worked as a private tutor teaching computer programming and other related subjects specially to students of UOC University.
  Finnaly in 2012 I traveled to USA, where I currently live and work as a proud USA citizen.
</p>

<p>In US I continued tutoring for two years until I started working full time 
  at Promo International Inc, where I created several reports for 
  management decision making, and develped from scratch a 
  web system to simplify sales.
</p>

<p>In 2016 I created with a partner our own software development company Ap Tec Software.
  Our purpose as a company was to create custom web application from scratch for
  businesses. I was in charge of all client interactions while my partner,
  a senior developer, handles all the technical details. Together we were able
  to improve some of my past project and developed some other from scratch.

<p>
  While I enjoied and learn a lot from our venture, I am ready to focus back in 
  programming. I' a'm a very commited person and I'm eager to find a 
  project where I can use my skils as programmer.
